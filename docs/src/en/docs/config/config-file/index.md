# minmini.config.json

Create a <u>minmini.config.json</u> file in the root directory of your project (the directory where the command is executed, not baseDir) to configure some of the options for minmini.

> If you want to use the default but need to keep the configuration name in minmini.config.json, you can use null because undefined is not allowed in JSON.
